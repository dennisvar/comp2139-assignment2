      /*From the Incidents by Technician page, the user can click the Edit button for an incident to update that incident.
This displays the Edit Incident page.
• The Edit Incident page allows the technician to modify the description and optionally enter the date the incident
was closed and click on the Save button.
• If the technician successfully updates an incident or cancels the update operation, the app should display the
Incidents by Technician list again.
• The website should store the technician’s ID in session state. That way, the website can “remember” the current
technician.*/
