     * The Get Technician page is only displayed by the Update Incident link on the Home page for the website. There’s
no link for it in the navigation bar.
• The Get Technician page allows the user to select the technician name. If the user doesn’t select a name, the app
should display a message indicating that the user must select a technician.
• The Incidents by Technician page displays all open incidents that have been assigned to the selected technician.
Or, if there are no open incidents for the current technician, this page displays a message that indicates that there
are no open incidents.
• To switch technicians, the user can click on the Switch button. This displays the Get Technician page again.
